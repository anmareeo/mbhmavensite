    <p>Maybe you're using the wrong organizing style. When it comes to organizing, it is not a "one size fits all" situation. After years of trying and failing to stay tidy and organized, I discovered the Clutterbug method of organizing, and now my home is always clean. I became a certified personal organizer, and I would love to help you discover the organizing method that will work for your personality type.</p>
